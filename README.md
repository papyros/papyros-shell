Papyros Shell is the desktop shell for Papyros, an operating system based upon Linux which conforms to Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. The focus will be on creating a stable and easy-to-use operating system with a heavy emphasis on well-thought-out design.

Brought to you by the [Papyros development team](https://github.com/papyros/papyros-shell/graphs/contributors).

### Implementation Details ###

The shell is built as a compositor for Wayland using the Green Island compositor framework and QtQuick. The goal is to develop a convergent shell that adapts to the form factor of the device it is running on, and to also support HIDPI screens.

Green Island provides the C++ code necessary to interact with Wayland, and QML Desktop provides C++ plugins for QML for the desktop indicators, so the majority of the shell is implemented in QML and Javascript.
 
Special thanks to Hawaii shell and its author Pier Luigi Fiorini for some of the QML backend plugins, including the hardware plugin and the original code for the app launcher model.

### Dependencies ###

 * Qt 5.5
 * Wayland
 * [GreenIsland](https://github.com/greenisland/greenisland)
   * Requires an in-development branch ([feature/window_manager](https://github.com/papyros/greenisland/tree/feature/window_manager)). This is branch is currently awaiting upstream review.
 * A Green Island development version of QtCompositor, as described on the Green Island GitHub page.
 * [QML Extras](https://github.com/papyros/qml-extras) (the `develop` branch).
 * [QML Material](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) (the `develop` branch).
 * [GSettings QML module](https://launchpad.net/gsettings-qt) (AUR package available for Arch Linux users).
 * Several KDE Frameworks
   * [KDeclarative](api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/kdeclarative/html/)
   * [Solid](api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/solid/html/)
 * ALSA or PulseAudio for the sound indicator

### Installation ###

Once the necessary dependencies are installed, you can build and install the Papyros shell as follows:

    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DQML_INSTALL_DIR=lib/qt/qml
    make && sudo make install

And run the compositor from an X11 desktop:

    greenisland --shell io.papyros.shell

Or from a virtual terminal as a full Wayland compositor:

    greenisland --platform eglfs --shell io.papyros.shell
